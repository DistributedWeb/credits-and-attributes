# DWeb License Agreement
Distributed Web  is a collection of thousands of computer programs and documents created by a range of individuals, teams and companies. Each of these programs may come under a different licence. This licence policy describes the process that we follow in determining which software will be included by default DWeb-based software.
<br/><br/>
Copyright licensing and trademarks are two different areas of law, and we consider them separately in DWeb-based software. The following policy applies only to copyright licences. We evaluate trademarks on a case-by-case basis.
<br/><br/>
By accepting this agreement or by installing any dWeb-related software, like dPack, dFTP, dBrowser or other software offered by or on behalf of Distributed Webs Project, LLC. (the "Software") or by clicking "Install" or similar language, you agree to the following terms, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this agreement.
<br/>
## DWeb Software Categories
The thousands of software packages used to created DWeb and available on the DWeb network are organized into three key groups or components: native, universal and third-party. Software is published in one of these components based on whether or not it meets our free software philosophy, and the level of support we can provide for it. In addition, software may be published for DWeb software packages or as "DPacks" (a "dPack" or "dPacks") in the distributed and peer-to-peer "DPack Repository" (the "dPack Repo"), in which case licenses are determined by the dPack publisher and documented in the dPack Repo at [https://dpacks.io](https://dpacks.io).
<br/>
The "DWeb License Agreement" (the "License") addresses the software that you will find in native, third-party and universal categories. Although, the "DWeb Support Team" (the "Support Team") only supports software that is found within the native and universal categories.
<br/><br/>
**Universally-categorized DWeb software** ("Universal Software") is defined as software that was created by a third-party but either modified, merged, published, distributed and/or sublicensed by Distributed Webs Project, LLC. and included, offered and/or sold by Distributed Webs Project, LLC.
<br/><br/>
**Natively-categorized DWeb software** ("Native Software") is defined as software that was either modified or created on a completely custom basis by Distributed Webs Project, LLC.
<br/><br/>
**Third Party-categorized DWeb software** ("Third Party Software") is defined as software that was created by a third party, is needed as either a software dependency, has been modified or renamed for use in DWeb software or is offered as separate software for developers who are developing "Distributed Websites" ("dSites") or "Distributed Applications" ("dApps") that reside on the "Distributed Web" (the "dWeb"). 
<br/><br/>
## DWeb Software Dependencies 
"DWeb Software Dependencies" (a "Depedency" or "Dependencies") are software libraries used within DWeb-based software that are required for dWeb's software to function properly. Instead of recreating the wheel, like most software, we have packaged small, yet very important libraries with DWeb software to create the best possible user experience and in some cases user interfaces. These dependencies carry their own licenses and are attributed to the original authors, when necessary, wherever that software is stored. If the software itself is simply carried as a dependency and isn't stored in a "Public Repository" (a "Repo") that is owned or operated by Distributed Webs Project, LLC., then it not considered as a supported software and will not be supported by our Support Team. 
<br/>
## License
Subject to your compliance with these terms and conditions, Distributed Webs Projects, LLC., grants you a royalty-free, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the Software, solely for your personal, non-commercial purposes. Distributed Webs Projects, LLC. reserves all rights in the Software not expressly granted to you here.
<br/>
## Restrictions
The source code, design, and structure of the Software are trade secrets. You will not disassemble, decompile, or reverse engineer it, in whole or in part, except to the extent expressly permitted by law, or distribute it. You will not use the Software for illegal purposes. You will comply with all export laws. The Software is licensed, not sold.
<br/>

## dPack Software Policy
All dSites and dApps submitted to the dPack repository and made available on the "DWeb Network" (the "Network") requirements:
<br/>

* Must allow redistribution. Your right to sell or give away the software alone, or as part of an aggregate software distribution, is important because:

* You, the user, must be able to pass on any software you have received on the Network or from DWeb in either source code or     compiled form.
* While DWeb will not charge licence fees for this distribution, you might want to charge to print DWeb CDs, or create your     own customised versions of DWeb which you sell, and should have the freedom to do so.
* Must not require royalty payments or any other fee for redistribution or modification. It's important that you can             exercise your rights to this software without having to pay for the privilege, and that you can pass these rights on to       other people on exactly the same basis.
* Must allow these rights to be passed on along with the Software. You should be able to have exactly the same rights to the     software as we do.
* Must not discriminate against persons, groups or against fields of endeavour. The licence of software included in the         Software can not discriminate against anyone or any group of users and cannot restrict users from using the software for a     particular field of endeavour - a business for example. So we will not distribute software that is licensed "freely for       non-commercial use".
* Must not be distributed under a licence specific to DWeb. The rights attached to the software must not depend on the           program being part of a DWeb-based system. So we will not distribute software for which DWeb has a "special" exemption         or right, and we will not put our own Software into DWeb and then refuse you the right to pass it on.
* Must not contaminate other software licences.The licence must not place restrictions on other software that is distributed     along with it. For example, the licence must not insist that all other programmes distributed on the same medium be free       software.
* May require source modifications to be distributed as patches. In some cases, software authors are happy for us to             distribute their software and modifications to their software, as long as the two are distributed separately, so that         people always have a copy of their pristine code. We are happy to respect this preference. However, the licence must           explicitly permit distribution of software built from modified source code.



## DWeb Documentation
DWeb contains licensed and copyrighted works that are not application software. For example, the default DWeb installation includes documentation, images, logos, videos, firmware and other copyrighted material that was not created by Distributed Webs Projects, LLC. The [DWeb Governance](https://dwebs.io/governance) will make decisions on the inclusion of these works on a case-by-case basis, ensuring that these works do not restrict our ability to make DWeb available free of charge, make available developer resources to grow the DWeb with dSites and dApps and that you can continue to redistribute the DWeb.
<br/>

## Software Installed By Default

When you install certain software like [dBrowser](https://dbrowser.io), will typically install a complete web browsing environment. Although the source code is not readily available for users, includes Dependencies that are automatically installed and needed for software like dBrowser to function properly, it is important to note the existence of these Dependencies. All of the Dependencies installed by default are free software. In addition, we install some "Software Performance and Tracking Software" (the "Software Performance Tracker"), that's used to track the performance of applications like dBrowser. It is up to the user on whether the Software Performance Tracker is enabled and can be disabled at any time. Although, the Software Performance Tracker is enabled by default. 
<br/>

## Licensing Credits
This license was created by combining several licenses from [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com/licensing) and [BitTorrent](https://www.bittorrent.com/legal/eula). Most things have been revised from these agreements but to stay in compliance with laws within the United States, it is important to credit both of these documents.
